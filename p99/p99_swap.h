/**
 ** @brief Swap the contents of the arguments.
 **
 ** This macro has the following properties:
 **  - It evaluates each of @a _0 and @a _1 only once.
 **  - It has a compile time check for the correct sizes.
 **  - It checks if the two expressions are assignment compatible in
 **    both ways
 **  - It has no naming issues with a hidden variable.
 **  - The size of the temporary variable is computed at compile
 **    time. So we may use a compound literal and not a dynamic array.
 **
 ** @remark This implementation is a follow up of a <a
 ** href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3982348/implement-generic-swap-macro-in-c/3983089#3983089">
 ** discussion on stackoverflow</a>.
 **
 ** @remark The concrete implementation separates into two different
 ** cases: @c P00_SWAP2(_0, _1), for small sizes, uses two
 ** temporaries in the hope that the loads into registers can be done
 ** simultaneously. The other one, @c P00_SWAP1(_0, _1), uses only one
 ** temporary but is then forced to serialize copy operations.
 **
 ** @warning For both arguments
 ** - each must be an lvalue expression
 ** - it must be permitted to take their addresses.
 **
 ** So variables that have the @c register storage class will not work
 ** with this macro.
 **
 ** @warning The types of the arguments are only checked to confirm that they
 ** have the same size @em and that the two lvalues are assignment
 ** compatible. If both are
 ** - of the same size,
 ** - are assignment compatible,
 ** - have different semantics,
 **
 ** you are in trouble. This may happen in the following cases:
 ** - A signed and unsigned type of same size, e.g <code>signed int</code> and
 **   <code>unsigned int</code>
 ** - Two integer types that by coincidence have the same size, e.g on
 **   a platform <code>long</code> and <code>long long</code> may
 **   both be 8 byte. This may work ok for a long time and then fail when
 **   you move to another platform.
 ** - If one type is a floating point type and the other an integral
 **   type, e.g @c double and a @c uint64_t may be of the same size.
 ** - Two types that have the same size but not the same width. A @c
 **   bool will usually be stored in one byte, but memcpy from a @c
 **   char is not equivalent to assigning it with @c =. Padding bits
 **   may have the effect that the value stored in a @c bool is a trap
 **   representation.
