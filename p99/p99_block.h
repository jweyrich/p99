/**
 ** @brief Unwind execution from several levels of nesting inside a
 ** function.
 **
 ** This macro allows several levels of block statements to be unwound safely.
 **
 ** @code
 ** P99_UNWIND_PROTECT {
 **   // do something
 **   while (cond0) {
 **     for (;cond1;) {
 **        if (cond2) P99_UNWIND(-1);
 **     }
 **   }
 **  P99_PROTECT :
 **   // do some cleanup here
 **   // if everything went well ::p99_unwind_code has value 0 otherwise it
 **   // receives a value from P99_UNWIND
 ** }
 ** @endcode
 **
 ** Here ::P99_UNWIND terminates the execution of the inner blocks and
 ** resumes execution at the special "label" ::P99_PROTECT, if
 ** present.
 **
 ** The argument to ::P99_UNWIND controls how many levels are
 ** unwound. If it is positive, at most the specified number of levels is
 ** unwound, but never more levels than there are on the call stack of
 ** the enclosing function. If it is negative, all levels on the stack
 ** of the enclosing function are unwound and during unwinding, this
 ** negative argument (that was passed to ::P99_UNWIND) is accessible
 ** through ::p99_unwind_code.
 **
 ** @warning Variables that are modified before the call to
 ** ::P99_UNWIND are only guaranteed to have their new value in the
 ** protected part if they are declared @c volatile.
 **
 ** Let us see this at an example. The natural way with
 ** ::P99_UNWIND_PROTECT to check for a valid return of @c malloc
 ** could look like this:
 **
 ** @code
 ** unsigned char*volatile buffer = 0;
 ** P99_UNWIND_PROTECT {
 **   buffer = malloc(bignumber);
 **   if (!buffer || IamSick) P99_UNWIND 1;
 **   // do something complicated with buffer
 ** P99_PROTECT:
 **   free(buffer);
 ** }
 ** @endcode
 **
 ** If we would not declare @c buffer to be @c volatile, the update to
 ** @c buffer with the new value would perhaps not be visible at the
 ** point that we call @c free. Under normal circumstance the compiler
 ** is allowed to optimize the store operation away (implied by the
 ** assignment), if he can prove that the only visible value of it
 ** comes from the last assignment. I could then just use a cached
 ** value (e.g in a register) to pass as an argument to @c free. The
 ** @c volatile qualifier inhibits such an optimization and forces
 ** memory-store operations when there is a modification and
 ** memory-load operations when there is access to the variable.
 **
 ** @warning There should be no plain @c return statement in the
 ** depending block before the ::P99_PROTECT label.
 **
 ** @see "test-p99-block.c" for a more sophisticated example of nested
 ** ::P99_UNWIND_PROTECT.
 ** @see ::P99_UNWIND
 ** @see ::P99_UNWIND_RETURN for a replacement of @c return that
 **      respects the protected parts
 ** @see ::P99_CHECK_RETURN to check for suspicious bare @c return statements
 ** @see ::p99_unwind_code
 ** @see ::p99_unwind_level
 ** @see ::P99_TRY and ::P99_THROW for a construct that can be used across function calls.
