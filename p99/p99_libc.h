/**
 ** @file
 ** @brief Group C library dependencies together in one file
 **
 ** The idea of this file is that different implementations of the C
 ** library may have particular features that are missing. If you have
 ** such a C library let me know and I will try to add it here.
 **
 ** Libraries that are conforming should be captured by the "#else"
 ** part, that is by the fallback. Libraries that are known to fall
 ** under this are
 **  - glibc, identifiable by __GLIBC__
 **  - musl, that doesn't set a special macro to identify itself
 **
 ** The only library that we currently know off that misses parts of
 ** the C library is avrlibc.
