 ** @brief Protect the following block or statement as a critical
 ** section of the program by using @a FLAGP as a spinlock.
 **
 ** @param FLAGP is an expression that evaluates to a pointer to
 ** ::atomic_flag. The flag is used as a spinlock, so this is an
 ** active wait.
 **
 ** @remark @a FLAGP is only evaluated once at the beginning, so it
 ** would be safe to change it in the depending block or statement.
 **
 ** @warning Such a section should only contain a handful of
 ** statements.
 **
 ** @warning Such a section should not contain preliminary exits such
 ** as @c goto, @c break, @c return, @c longjmp, or ::P99_UNWIND etc.
 **
 ** Such a critical section is only protected against threads that try
 ** to enter this same critical section. Threads may well
 ** simultaneously be in different critical sections.
 **
 ** @see P99_MUTUAL_EXCLUDE that is more suited for larger sections.
