/**
 ** @brief A simple rwlock implementation.
 **
 ** This is implemented more or less efficiently according to the
 ** features that the platform provides:
 ** - one that uses atomic operations and futexes for signaling
 ** - one that mutexes all access and uses a condition variable for
 **   signaling.
 **
 ** It has the following properties:
 **
 ** - A lock that is obtained is not bound to a specific thread, any
 **   thread may unlock it.
 **
 ** - If there is a rdlock that is hold, any thread may call
 **   ::p99_rwl_rdlock, again, on the same object. It is the
 **   responsibility of the application to ensure that
 **   ::p99_rwl_unlock is called as many times as it has been locked.
 **
 ** - If a wrlock is hold, nobody, the holding thread including, will
 **   be blocked when calling ::p99_rwl_rdlock or ::p99_rwl_wrlock.
 **
 ** As a consequence, this form of lock can be easily cleaned up if a
 ** thread has left it locked and then walked away:
 ** @code
 ** p99_rwl rwl = P99_RWL_INITIALIZER;
 **
 ** while (p99_rwl_islocked(&rwl))
 **       p99_rwl_unlock(&rwl);
 ** @endcode
 **
 ** This takes care of all situations where no other thread actively
 ** is trying to achieve the lock.
