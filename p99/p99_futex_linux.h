/**
 ** @brief Wait until the value to which @a ADDR points to fulfills
 ** expression @a EXPECTED.
 **
 ** @param ADDR is a valid address that is interpreted as pointing to
 ** an @c int object.
 **
 ** @param NAME must be an identifier. It serves to declare an
 ** internal variable
 ** that will hold @c (*ADDR) and which should be used in expression
 ** @a EXPECTED.
 **
 ** @param EXPECTED is a expression that evaluates @a NAME and that
 ** should not have side effects.
 **
 ** If it is not fulfilled initially, this macro blocks execution of
 ** the calling thread until the thread is woken up @em and @a
 ** EXPECTED is fulfilled. That is if each occurence of @a NAME in @a
 ** EXPECTED is replaced by the current value of @c (*ADDR) and then
 ** the evaluation of the resulting expression returns a truth value.
 **
 ** It is the responsibility of the application to issue the
 ** corresponding calls to wake up potential waiters whenever the
 ** value of @c (*ADDR) is changed.
 **
 ** Take the following example of a counter implementation:
 ** @code
 ** enum { why = 42 };
 ** int count = 0;
 **
 ** // some thread waiting for the count to become more than why.
 ** P00_FUTEX_WAIT(&count, x, x > why);
 **
 ** // some thread augmenting the count. wake up potential
 ** // waiters.
 ** atomic_fetch_add(&count, 1);
 ** p00_futex_broadcast(&count);
 **
 ** // some thread reducing the count. no need to wake up potential
 ** // waiters.
 ** atomic_fetch_sub(&count, 1);
 ** @endcode
 **
 ** @warning It is probably not a good idea to have the evaluation of
 ** a variable (other than @a NAME) inside expression @a EXPRESSION
 ** that is subject to changes.
 ** @see p00_futex_wake
 ** @see p00_futex_signal
 ** @see p00_futex_broadcast
