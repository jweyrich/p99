/**
 ** @brief Create a block that can catch exceptions
 **
 ** @remark This must be used with either ::P99_CATCH or ::P99_FINALLY
 ** following immediately after the depending block.
 **
 ** The simplest use of this feature is together with ::P99_FINALLY
 ** @code
 ** unsigned char*volatile buffer = 0;
 ** P99_TRY {
 **   buffer = malloc(bignumber);
 **   if (!buffer) P99_THROW(thrd_nomem);
 **   // do something complicated with buffer
 **   favorite_func(buffer);
 ** } P99_FINALLY {
 **   free(buffer);
 ** }
 ** @endcode
 **
 ** This will ensure that the buffer allocated in @c buffer will
 ** always be freed, regardless of any error conditions the code
 ** encounters. In particular this will work, even if an exception is
 ** thrown from below the call to @c favorite_func.
 **
 ** If no exception occurs, the ::P99_FINALLY clause is always executed.
 ** Execution then continues after the clause, just as for
 ** normal code.
 **
 ** If an exception occurs, the ::P99_FINALLY clause is executed (and in this case
 ** the call to @c free is issued). But afterwards, execution will not
 ** continue as normal but instead will jump to the next ::P99_FINALLY or
 ** ::P99_CATCH block on the call stack.
 **
 ** An alternative way is to use ::P99_CATCH and to handle different
 ** exceptions explicitly.
 **
 ** @code
 ** unsigned char*volatile buffer = 0;
 ** P99_TRY {
 **   buffer = malloc(bignumber);
 **   if (!buffer) P99_THROW(thrd_nomem);
 **   // do something complicated with buffer
 ** } P99_CATCH(int code) {
 **   switch(code) {
 **     case thrd_nomem: perror("we had an allocation error"); break;
 **     case thrd_timedout: perror("we were timed out"); break;
 **   }
 **   free(buffer);
 **   if (code) P99_RETHROW;
 ** }
 ** @endcode
 **
 ** The difference here is that we receive the error code through the
 ** variable @c code and we can thus take different action for
 ** different exceptional conditions. If it weren't for the
 ** ::P99_RETHROW, the unrolling of the call stack would stop at this
 ** point and execution would continue after the catch block. The
 ** exception would be considered caught.
 **
 ** Here, since there is a ::P99_RETHROW, execution will jump to the
 ** next ::P99_FINALLY or ::P99_CATCH block on the call stack. In fact
 ** a catch clause of
 **
 ** @code
 ** P99_CATCH(int code) {
 **   // do something here and then
 **   if (code) P99_RETHROW;
 ** }
 ** @endcode
 **
 ** Would be equivalent to
 **
 ** @code
 ** P99_FINALLY {
 **   // do something here
 ** }
 ** @endcode
 **
 ** except that this wouldn't give access to @c code.
 **
 ** Note that the code depending on ::P99_TRY must always be an entire
 ** block with <code>{ }</code> surrounding it. The code depending on
 ** ::P99_FINALLY or ::P99_CATCH doesn't have that restriction and could
 ** be just a single statement.
