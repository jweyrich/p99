<div class="title">P99 - Preprocessor macros and functions for C99 and C11 </div>  </div>
</div><!--header-->
<div class="contents">
<div class="textblock"><p>P99 is a suite of macro and function definitions that ease programming in modern C, aka C99. By using new facilities in C99 we implement default arguments for functions, scope bound resource management, transparent allocation and initialization, ...</p>
<p>By using special features of some compilers and operating systems, we also are able to provide an almost feature complete emulation of the newer C standards as e.g from C11.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="introduction"></a>
Macros and inline functions working together</h1>
<p>In C, functions (whether <code>inline</code> or not) and macros fulfill different purposes. Their difference should not be seen as ideological as some seem to take it, and what is even more important, they may work nicely together.</p>
<p>Macros are text replacement that is done at compile time and they can do things like <a class="el" href="group__integers_ga3eb39ccac28ebd8265c1a31dc00f53ab.html#ga3eb39ccac28ebd8265c1a31dc00f53ab" title="Determine if EXPR has an unsigned or signed integral type.">P99_SIGNED(EXPR)</a> which is defined by P99. That macro takes an expression as an argument, and tells at compile time of whether or not the integral type of <code>EXPR</code> is signed or not. Additionally it guarantees that <code>EXPR</code> itself is not evaluated at run time (so there are no side effects), but that only its type is taken into consideration.</p>
<p>Such an example shows that macros are ideally used when the type of an expression is to be determined and you want to act accordingly to that type. On the other hand, the pitfall with macros is that their arguments may be evaluated several times, which is bad because of side effects.</p>
<p>Functions on the other hand are typed, which makes them more strict or, phrased negatively, less flexible. Consider the function</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="keyword">inline</span></div>
<div class="line"><a class="code" href="p99__str_8h_acd5465f6b44ffc9448f6876c140bfa7f.html#acd5465f6b44ffc9448f6876c140bfa7f">uintmax_t</a> p00_abs_signed(intmax_t a) {</div>
<div class="line"> <span class="keywordflow">return</span> (a &lt; 0) ? -(<a class="code" href="p99__str_8h_acd5465f6b44ffc9448f6876c140bfa7f.html#acd5465f6b44ffc9448f6876c140bfa7f">uintmax_t</a>)a : (<a class="code" href="p99__str_8h_acd5465f6b44ffc9448f6876c140bfa7f.html#acd5465f6b44ffc9448f6876c140bfa7f">uintmax_t</a>)a;</div>
<div class="line">}</div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>It takes signed integer value <code>a</code> and computes its absolute value. Observe that the return type of this function is unsigned. This has to be so, since otherwise not all valid values could be realized.</p>
<p><code>p00_abs_signed</code> would not be a good candidate for a macro, since <code>a</code> is evaluated twice in the expression; once in the controlling expression and once for returning its value or its negation.</p>
<p>We may use this function with any integral type, but then the result would probably not be what a naive programmer would expect if the argument is a large unsigned value. The argument will be promoted to <code>intmax_t</code>. If the value <code>X</code> that is passed to the call is positive and greater than <code> INTMAX_MAX = 2<sup>N</sup> -1</code>, the result is probably not what we'd expect. If the conversion to <code>intmax_t</code> doesn't result in a range error thrown by the run time system (it would be permitted to do so), the argument <em>a</em> of the function would receive the negative value <code>-C</code> where <code>C</code> is <code>2<sup>N</sup></code> - X. The result of the function call would then be <code>C</code> and not <code>X</code>.</p>
<p>With the following macro we get rid of these restrictions by combining the macro and the function:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="preprocessor">#define P99_ABS(EXPR) (P99_SIGNED(EXPR) ? p00_abs_signed(EXPR) : (EXPR))</span></div>
</div><!-- fragment --><p>This has the following properties</p>
<ul>
<li>
For any integral type it returns the correct result.  </li>
<li>
The argument <code>EXPR</code> is evaluated exactly once. </li>
<li>
Any recent and decent compiler will create <a class="el" href="c99.html#inline">optimal code</a> for that combined macro.  </li>
</ul>
<p>In that spirit, P99 aims to provide utilities that often combine macros and <code>inline</code> funcions and that are only possible with the <a class="el" href="c99.html">features</a> that come with C99 (read ISO C as normalized in 1999) and that were absent in C89. The features include among others</p><ul>
<li><a class="el" href="c99.html#variadic">Variadic macros</a></li>
<li><a class="el" href="c99.html#inline">Inline functions</a></li>
<li><a class="el" href="c99.html#initializers">Designated initializers</a></li>
<li><a class="el" href="c99.html#compound">Compound literals</a></li>
<li><a class="el" href="c99.html#hide">Macros that hide a function</a></li>
<li><a class="el" href="c99.html#pragma">Pragmas inside macros</a></li>
</ul>
<p>On some platforms, P99 is also able to emulate the main features that come with C11 or C17:</p><ul>
<li><a class="el" href="group__generic.html">Generic type expressions</a></li>
<li><a class="el" href="group__atomic.html">C11 atomic operations</a></li>
<li><a class="el" href="group__threads.html">C11 thread emulation on top of POSIX threads</a></li>
</ul>
<p>With all these features it implements <a class="el" href="utilities.html">utilities</a> that previously had not been possible to program in C (or C macros) or that were very difficult to implement</p><ul>
<li><a class="el" href="utilities.html#defaults">Default arguments to functions</a></li>
<li><a class="el" href="utilities.html#blocks">Scope-bound resource management with for-statements</a></li>
<li><a class="el" href="utilities.html#condi">Preprocessor conditionals and loops</a></li>
<li><a class="el" href="utilities.html#alloc">Allocation and initialization facilities</a></li>
</ul>
<p>P99 also provides numerous facilities for <a class="el" href="programming.html">macro programming.</a></p>
<p>P99 is not a C library in the classical sense but merely a collection of include files:</p><ul>
<li>There is no binary library to be linked to your executable. The few functions that are provided are small wrappers that are compiled directly into your code.</li>
<li>There is nothing to configure, P99 include files should work out of the box with any conforming C99 compiler.</li>
</ul>

      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
      replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
      the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
      comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
      file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
